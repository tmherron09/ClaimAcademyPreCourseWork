Java Pre-Course Work for Claim Academy Admissions

## Claim Academy Technical Review

Similiar to the two text files, this repo contains both a shorthand and a long form of the answers.

The shorthand looks to provide only the answers with minimal console output formatting. It removes most comments and documentation.
It also removes multiple approaches. Hopefully leaving the one that is being sought out. (Using the most efficient method was not my goal
but rather just demonstrate the skills required.

The long form answer provides everything I have been working on. It was good practice for formatting console output. I also explore
documentation commenting, String.format(), along with other things I was just curious how to do in Java or Eclipse.

## Getting Started

You should know this if you're teaching me.
